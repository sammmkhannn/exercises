        <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
        <p>Molly had been starring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of <i>Nature</i>,<i>New Scientist</i>, and all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favourite book since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free. </p>
        <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar wilde quote proclaiming that<q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding achivement,Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.</p>
