        <p>A pragraph consists of one or more sentences
           that form a self-contained uint of discourse. The
           start of a paragraph is indicated by a new 
           line.</p>
        <p> Text is easier to understand when it is split up
            into units of text. For example, a book may have
            chapters. Chapters may have subheadings. Under
            each heading there will be one or more
            paragraphs</p>
