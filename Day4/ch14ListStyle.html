    <h1>Quotes from Edgar Allan Poe</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>I have great faith in fools: self-confidence my friend call it.</li>
        <li>All that we see or seem is but a dream within  a dream.</li>
        <li>I would define, in brief, the property of words as the rhythmical creation of Beauty.</li>
    </ul>
