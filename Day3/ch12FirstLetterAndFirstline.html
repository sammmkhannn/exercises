        <h4>The briad, or berger de brie, is a large breed of dog traditionally used as a herder and gardian of sheep.</h4>
        <h2>Breed History</h2>
        <p class="intro">The briard, which is believed to have originated in France, has been bred for centuries to herd and to protect
            sheep. The breed was used by the French Army as sentries, messengers and to search for wounded soldiers 
            because of it's fine sense of hearing. Briards were used in the First World War almost to the poin of 
            extinction. Currently the population of briards is slowly recovering. Charlemagne,Napoleon,
            Thomas Jefferson and Lafayette all owned briards.
