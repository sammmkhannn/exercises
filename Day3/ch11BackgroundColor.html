        <h2>The Composition of Seawater</h2>
        <p>Almost anything can be found in seawater. This includes dissolved materials from Earth's
            crust as well as material released from organisms. The most important components of seawater
            that influence life forms are salinity, temperature, dissolved gases(mostly oxygen and cabon 
            dioxide,nutrients, and pH. These elements vary in their composition as well as in their influence
            on marine life.</p>
